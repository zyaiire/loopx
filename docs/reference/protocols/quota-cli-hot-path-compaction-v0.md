# Quota CLI Hot-Path Compaction v0

`quota_cli_hot_path_compaction_v0` bounds the default agent-facing
`quota should-run` projection without changing the decision computed by the
quota control plane. The full decision is built first. CLI-only projection then
retains action authority on the hot path and moves repeated diagnostic detail
behind explicit `--include-detail` selectors.

## Ownership Boundary

The quota control plane owns decision, precedence, scheduler, interaction,
selected-todo, and user-action semantics. `cli_projection.py` owns only the
serialized view consumed by agents. A compactor must not become a second
decision owner or recompute any route.

The default projection retains:

- `decision`, `should_run`, `effective_action`, and `recommended_action`;
- selected todo, bounded `action_portfolio`, read-only `planning_horizon`, and
  execution obligation;
- interaction mode, user channel, and executable agent/CLI actions;
- scheduler action and autonomous-replan authority;
- the compact vision decision, trigger kinds, required reads, and judge result;
- warning kinds, counts, stable identities, and cold-path references.

`action_portfolio` is not diagnostic candidate noise. It is retained in the
default packet because it carries the executable fallback rule when the
selected primary becomes unavailable at its real call site. Compaction may
remove the larger todo/capability candidate lists only after preserving this
bounded portfolio unchanged.

The `turn_envelope_action_dimensions_v2` base/head migration has a JSON-only,
bounded growth allowance for this additive portfolio. The allowance applies
only while a v0/v1 baseline migrates to v2, remains a review signal, and still
fails above 1,280 characters/bytes, 36 lines, or 896 compact characters. Once
v2 is the baseline, the ordinary hot-path growth limits apply again.

`quota_planning_horizon_v0` is likewise action-bearing context rather than
diagnostic noise. The compact path preserves its bounded Todo chain, typed
relations, attention ids, completeness counters, and cold-path refs unchanged.
Its `turn_envelope_action_dimensions_v3` migration receives one JSON-only
allowance of 3,200 characters/bytes, 84 lines, or 2,800 compact characters.
That allowance applies only to `none -> quota_planning_horizon_v0` together
with v0/v1/v2 action coverage moving to v3. Once v3 is the baseline, ordinary
growth limits resume. The horizon remains read-only and never replaces
`selected_todo` or explicit action-portfolio selection.

Repeated vision audits use `$.vision_continuation_audit` as the canonical
projection. Candidate lists and peer action lists retain counts and point to
`--include-detail agent-todos`. The complete vision audit is available through
`--include-detail vision`; `--include-detail all` restores every supported
detail section.

## Qualification Contract

Deterministic tests own exact full-versus-compact parity, cold-path restoration,
schema shape, and the character budget. The real-scale regression must exceed
the default budget before compaction and remain within it afterward.

Model qualification is one-arm and actual-default. The shipped
`actual_default_model_behavior_portfolio_v0` sends the CLI hot-path projection,
not the unprojected in-memory decision, to the Doubao actor. Its independent
source oracle must still observe the expected selected todo, user gate,
execution obligation, scheduler route, and vision/replan behavior on every
repeat. The planning-horizon scenario additionally starts from fixed typed
facts, validates the complete strategic relation chain independently of the
producer, and requires bounded model readback of the horizon before selected
work. Removing the horizon, breaking a middle relation, or drifting both the
producer and compact packet fails before provider spend. A dedicated
compaction-regression scenario must exceed the JSON hot-path
budget before projection, fit within the budget afterward, preserve the exact
source-derived semantic contract, and preserve the model's route. Two additional
over-budget scenarios repeat clean selected-work and blocking-gate contracts
under omitted diagnostic noise. Bounded contrast results require those pairs to
remain invariant, while blocking versus non-blocking user action and selected
work versus required vision replan remain distinguishable. Exact helper
traversal, omitted counts, warning references, deduplication, and peer-route
shape remain deterministic projection-test responsibilities. The old full
packet is not retained as a permanent second product contract; paired mode is
reserved for explicit differential diagnosis.

The portfolio also includes a future-primary scenario: a typed P0 monitor whose
window is not due remains visible as unavailable higher-priority work while the
actual-default model must execute the selected ready fallback. This qualifies
model obedience to the projection; deterministic tests separately cover the
legacy case where a sticky primary survives and the packet must still expose
fallback actions.

Live receipts may retain only bounded scenario outcomes and digests. Packets,
prompts, raw model responses, credentials, and conversations remain outside the
repository.
