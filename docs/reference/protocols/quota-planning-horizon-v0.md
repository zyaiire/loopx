# quota_planning_horizon_v0

`quota_planning_horizon_v0` is the bounded, read-only context that lets an
agent reason beyond one locally selected Todo without inlining LoopX's full
Todo store or task graph. It is present on the default `quota should-run` path
only when the current selected work has typed lineage, waiting/blocking,
scheduled-observation, or goal-acceptance context. Flat runnable alternatives
remain solely in `action_portfolio`, avoiding a duplicate hot-path view.

The problem it addresses is narrower than scheduling. A selected regression
gate can be locally runnable while the strategic path also contains a facts
source, policy decision, runtime admission, and per-target validation. Showing
only the gate, or only two alternative actions, can make a model optimize the
visible leaf. The planning horizon makes that bounded chain visible. It does
not silently replace the selected Todo.

## Ownership

- Existing Todo, claim, capability, goal-frontier, and event-ledger contracts
  remain authoritative.
- Python adapts those already-derived facts into one typed request. It does not
  infer hierarchy from Todo prose.
- The TypeScript work-item reducer validates identities, de-duplicates facts,
  derives typed lineage/resume/route relations, orders context, applies limits,
  and emits completeness metadata.
- Effect Program transports the completed observation into TurnEnvelope. It
  does not own Todo dependency, resume, or action-selection semantics.
- `selected_todo` and `action_portfolio` remain the only action-selection
  authorities. Planning-horizon items are context until the agent performs the
  existing explicit selection/re-entry flow.

## Bounds And Ordering

The v0 reducer accepts at most 32 source candidates and projects at most:

- 5 Todo context items;
- 8 typed relations;
- 2 goal acceptance gaps;
- 3 `attention_todo_ids`.

The selected Todo is first. Typed relatives of the selected Todo are next,
ordered outward through the relation graph. Unrelated waiting, blocked, or
scheduled context follows before higher-priority and other runnable
alternatives; the action portfolio already owns flat alternative choice. This
ordering helps the agent reconstruct a strategic chain while keeping the
selected Todo identity stable.

`planning_state` is one of `selected`, `runnable`, `waiting`, `blocked`,
`scheduled`, or `context`. `context_reasons` explains why a non-selected item
was retained, for example `related_to_selected`,
`higher_priority_than_selected`, or `runnable_alternative`.

Every omitted source, candidate, relation, gap, or compacted text field is
counted. `complete=true` is valid only when all of those counts are zero. A
consumer must follow `detail_refs` when the answer depends on omitted context;
it must not treat the five visible items as the entire Goal.
`source_context_todo_count` counts current open plus deferred Todos; completed
history is intentionally outside this planning view.

When the same observation is nested in `loopx_turn_envelope_v0`, the transport
may replace the repeated `detail_refs` object with
`detail_refs_ref="$.detail_ref"`. The Turn envelope's top-level cold path then
owns those reads. This is transport compaction only: it does not change the
TypeScript reducer output, completeness accounting, or action authority.

## Relation Semantics

The v0 relation kinds are:

- `successor`: derived from `successor_todo_ids`, with
  `enforcement=lineage_only`;
- `unblocks`: derived from `unblocks_todo_id`, with typed lifecycle semantics;
- `resumes_when`: derived from `resume_when`, with typed condition semantics;
- `superseded_by`: persisted lineage only;
- `routes_via`: a read-only reference to the existing route id/key.

The distinction between lineage and enforcement is intentional. A successor
link is not upgraded into a hard dependency merely because the planning view
can draw a chain. v0 does not infer `depends_on` from phrases such as "after",
"requires", or "blocked by". A future hard dependency requires a separate
typed Todo contract and transition policy.

## Effect Program Boundary

Effect Program gains one nullable `planning_horizon` observation so every host
that consumes TurnEnvelope can receive the same domain-owned projection. This
is a transport extension, not a generic planning reducer. Todo resume remains
Todo-local reducer/ACK semantics, and quota selection remains in its existing
typed boundaries.

TurnEnvelope action-signature coverage advances to
`turn_envelope_action_dimensions_v3` when the horizon is present. CLI
differential qualification recognizes only the paired migration
`none -> quota_planning_horizon_v0` and v0/v1/v2 action coverage to v3. That
transition receives one bounded JSON growth allowance. Once v0 is in the base,
ordinary hot-path growth limits apply again.

## Acceptance Checks

A conforming implementation must prove:

- the TypeScript reducer owns validation, ordering, de-duplication, and bounds;
- the Python adapter consumes existing typed facts and creates no second store;
- the horizon never changes `selected_todo` or action-portfolio eligibility;
- typed successor/resume/route relations survive the default compact path;
- prose-only dependency claims create no relation;
- truncation and source incompleteness are explicit;
- the selected Todo detail and optional full task graph remain reachable;
- full quota and TurnEnvelope action signatures cover the same horizon;
- deterministic mutation tests reject a missing or producer-drifted horizon
  before live-model spend;
- live model evidence is retained only as bounded receipts, never raw prompts,
  responses, credentials, or local paths.
